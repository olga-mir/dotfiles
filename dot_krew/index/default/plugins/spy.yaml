  shortDescription: pod debugging tool for kubernetes clusters with docker runtimes
  version: v0.3.3
  description: |
    `kubespy` is a kubectl plugin implemented in bash to debug a running pod.
    It starts a temporary `spy container` which joins the namespaces of the
    target container (eg. pid/net/ipc). You can specify the image of `spy
    container` which should include all the required debugging tools. Thus,
    the debugging tools need not unnecessarily be bundled with the main
    application container image.

    `kubespy` is similar to [kubectl-debug](https://github.com/verb/kubectl-debug).
    In contrast to the latter, kubespy works without the EphemeralContainers
    feature which is an experimental alpha feature and needs to be activated
    per pod.

    Meanwhile `kubespy` has its prerequisites - the cluster must use docker as
    container runtime and you need to be able to run privileged pods.

    Usage:
      kubectl spy POD [-c CONTAINER] [-n NAMESPACE] [--spy-image SPY_IMAGE]

  caveats: |
    This plugin can only work with nodes with a docker runtime with admin
    privileges and you need to be able to run privileged pods.
