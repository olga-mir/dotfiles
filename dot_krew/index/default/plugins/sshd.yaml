    This plugin allows users to run a SSH server (Dropbear) in a running Pod.
    Running a temporary SSH server can be useful to execute applications
    that rely on SSH as a protocol, such as scp, rsync and rdiff-backup.
    However, this plugin should not be used as a replacement for `kubectl exec`
    and `kubectl cp`.
